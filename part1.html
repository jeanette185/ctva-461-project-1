  <p class="mb-6 text-xl md:text-2xl uppercase"> Avocado Toast has become a popular dish for breakfast, brunch and really for anytime of the day.</p>

  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">According to the  <a class="no-underline text-black hover:text-pink"    href="#">Washington Post, </p></a> <p class="mb-4 text-lg">There has been over 100,000 instagram tags on avocado toast alone. It has definitely made its way in becoming the new breakfast dish all over the world but mostly in Los Angeles. However its recipe has been known since 1999!</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg"> Now there are many ways to eat avocado. One can simply cut in and serve it as is. Or some may choose to smash it add salt, lime, cilantro, etc. Some more daring can even deep fry it or make it out of ice cream. Yes, ice cream! Gross or delicious? Probably both, anyway the point is that there are many ways to eat avocado. In a sandwhich, on tacos, mac and cheese, but for today we are sticking with how it's made with toast. As said earlier, the recipe of avocado toast began many years ago with plenty of chefs smashing avocados and serving it with toast or even feta.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">Nathan Toleman (co-founder and CEO of The Kettle Back and Top Paddock) said he first serve avocado with feta cheese when he first opened one of his resturants. Although his recipe did not include the avocadoo being smashed. Other Chefs remember serving famous avocado dishes back in the late 90s before everyone realized how good and healthy it really was for people.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">Chef and resturant owner, Bill Granger had avocado toast on his menu in 1993! His secret was just avocado, lime, sea salt, and olive oil placed over toast. So simple yet delicious and apparently still effective. Granger says now more than ever this dish alone is one of his popular dishes to be sold in his resturants located in Sydney, London, Tokyo, Honolulu and Seoul. Although he takes no credit into making avocado toast so popular, he is certain that Australians are respondsible of this popular trend since it is a common Australian breakfast</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">Now it's clear that avocado can be eaten with almost anything. Almost many resturants, fast-food places, and more offer avocado topping as little as one dollar extra but sometimes as high as 5 dollars extra! The more popular avocado has become the more expensive it has become as well due to popular demand. Chipotle offers avocado for almost three dollars extra but best believe people will be willing to pay this or even more for avocado.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg"> I think what makes avocado toast so popular to many people of different races, ages, and food preferances is because it really is such a universal dish to all. It's healthy, can be made vegan or gluten free, it can have a great poached egg on top, made into smoothies, desserts, salads and many other endless possibilities. It is limitless what one can make avocado toast with. This trend really made its way to the top of mostly every menu when Gweyneth Paltow made her own cooking book including a recipe for avocado toast made three different ways. Which then got foodies to make her version and other versions of the dish.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">The avocado itself is really what makes anything a super food. According to WebMD, an avocado offers nearly 20 vitamins and minerals in every serving. It contains potassium, B vitamins, vitamin C and E, it's low in sugar, and helps lower bad cholestrol. Avocados are really high in fat but it's a "good fat" which doesn't hurt to have every once in a while.</p>

  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">Yes, avocado is indeed a fruit! The avocado contains a single large seed known as a "pit" or a "stone".</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">Dinette is a small cafe near Echo Park. With their big plates filled with deliciousness, they may just have the best avocado toast with a poached egg on top. For just less than 10 dollars anyone can enjoy this simple but great dish. Prices may vary but go check it out whenever you are in town!</p>
